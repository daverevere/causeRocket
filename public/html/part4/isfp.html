<h2>You go with the flow</h2>

				<p>"Well, Gron," you begin. "I like to chew and swallow my bites. It tastes like candy!"</p>
				<p>Gron gasps and Garge grabs your shoulders. "You swallowed asteroid?" he cries.</p>
				<p>"Only a little," you reply sheepishly.</p>
				<p>"Asteroid can't be eaten!" cries Grong.</p>
				<p>You feel your stomach rumble and rise just then. Putting a hand on Garge's shoulder, you throw up a pile of sticky, rock mush. At the same time, a deep, unhappy song pours at your mouth.</p>
				<p>"I see what you mean," you cough.</p>
				<p>"The asteriods are alive," Gron explains. "The crystals are the songs they make. We crunch to hear their music, not to eat their flesh."</p>
				<p>"That's not what I meant, {{user.name}}," says Garge. "The better way to mine is... together!"</p>
				<p>"Oh," you reply. "Right!"</p>
				<p>"There is only one miner to asteriod," Garge continues. "I liked two, better."</p>
				<p>"Three is nice too," Gron adds.</p>
				<p>You mine with Garge and Gron for a bit, but soon you feel the time has come to return home. Garge and Gron set your rocket upright and hug you goodbye.</p>
				<p>"Farewell, asteriod eater!" Gron calls as you climb inside the rocket.</p>
				<p>"We'll miss you friend!" cries Garge.</p>
				<p>You wave and close the hatch. Looking at the single button lit up on the panel, you consider all that you've learned about yourself.</p>
				
				<p>You enjoy being by yourself or with one or two friends.</p>
				<p>You learn better by trying things for yourself.</p>
				<p>You notice how others feel and want everyone to be happy.</p>
				<p>You're spontaneous and like to stay open to whatever happens.</p>

				<b>You might especially enjoy volunteering with children, animals or in the arts. Rocket home to discover opportunities in these areas for kids in {{user.city}}.</b>
