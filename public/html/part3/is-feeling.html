<h2>You try to eat the asteriod</h2>

				<p>As you begin to chew on the rock near Garge, you're surpised to discover that it's sweet. With a little effort, it crumbles in your mouth like a piece of hard candy. You're no match for Garge though, who chomps whole craters in seconds before spitting them out in a sticky pile. But he doesn't seem to mind your slow pace.</p>
				<p>"I like this way better," he calls merrily. "Look out, asteriods! We mine TOGETHER."</p>
				<p>You chew for some time before finally pulling free a long crystal shard. It chimes a catchy tune, and Garge cheers.</p>
				<p>"Keep it, {{user.name}}," he says. "Something to remember me by when you go home."</p>
				<p>You hug the jolly miner. "I don't think you have to worry about that, Garge!"</p>
				<p>"We've got tell Gron about this," he says, grabbing the crystal he'd taken earlier. "Follow me!" You return with him to the surface. He jumps up towards another asteriods and doesn't come down. "Follow me!" he calls as he floats away.</p>
				<p>You leap towards him and land moments later on the nearby rock.</p>
				<p>Garge shakes his crystal. The little melody resonates across the surface. A moment later, the ground errupts as another miner, larger and darker than Garge, springs from it.</p>
				<p>"Gron," Garge calls. "{{user.name}} here has taught me a better way to mine!"</p>
				<p>"Ho {{user.name}}," Gron says. "Teach me."</p>
				<p>The thing is, you're not sure what Garge is talking about. Should you just go with the flow and make your best guess? Who knows what good, surpising thing you'll tell Gron? Or does it make more sense to ask Garge to explain. This way both you and Gron will understand clearly what he's talking about.</p>
