<h2>Mine song crystals</h2>

				<p>"Okay, Garge," you say. "Let's do it!"</p>
				<p>With a gravely "Whoopee!" Garge leads you down the little tunnel from which he sprang a moment before. You worm your way down the narrow hole, using the jagged sides for support. Along the way, Garge tells you that song crystals are the rarest minerals in this solar system. When shaken, each crystal chimes a unique melody that nourishes the miners like food.</p>
				<p>"So you don't eat?" you ask.</p>
				<p>"Only the asteriods when we're tunneling," Garge replies.</p>
				<p>"You tunnel with your mouth?" you ask with surprise.</p>
				<p>"Scrumptious rocks," Garge says. "Try it, {{user.name}}. You may like it. You and me could be an asteriod busting team!"
				<p>He leads you into a ball-shaped cave. It's lit by several outcroppings of glowing pink crystals.</p>
				<p>He begins to chomp on the rock around the outcroppings, loosening the crystals.</p>
				<p>"What are you waiting for, {{user.name}}?" he calls, spitting rock.</p>
				<p>Should you join Garge and try some rock munching? It won't be pleasant, but you could risk hurting his feelings if you don't try.</p>
				<p>Or should you just explain to Garge that you're not designed for asteriod eating? It seems a lot more logical to figure out another way to help him.</p>
